# 🐟 The ML Guppie

**Swimming through Machine Learning, one tiny project at a time.**

## 🌊 About This Journey

I'm a Software Engineer, currently navigating the vast ocean of Machine Learning and AI. This repository documents my **public learning journey** through small, practical, and sometimes funny ML projects.

### Why "The ML Guppie"?
- 🐟 **Guppy**: A small fish in a big ocean (ML field)
- 📚 **Learning in Public**: Documenting the messy, real process
- 🎯 **Tiny Projects**: Bite-sized, weekly projects that reinforce concepts
- 🔄 **From .NET to Neural Nets**: Transitioning from backend engineering to ML
